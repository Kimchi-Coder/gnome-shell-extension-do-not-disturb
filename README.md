**Version 2.0.6** - [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Do not disturb mode will block notifications from appearing on the screen, and will only display a dot next to the date indicating that a notification has arrived.

## Getting started
### Install
To install, use the GNOME Shell Extension web store:  https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1480/do-not-disturb/

#### Build from sources (optional)
Clone this repo and use make to install

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/kylecorry31/gnome-shell-extension-do-not-disturb
$ cd gnome-shell-extension-do-not-disturb
$ make install
```

The extension then must be enabled using GNOME Tweak Tool or at https://extensions.gnome.org/local/

### Usage
Once the extension is enabled, open the notification panel by clicking on the date in the top bar and click the toggle at the bottom of that panel for do not disturb. To deactive it, follow the same instructions, but toggle the do not distub off.
